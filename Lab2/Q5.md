Q5: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

```
START
INPUT NTH, n
Checker = n % NTH
IF Checker == 0
  THAN PRINT  NTH "is a divisor of " n
ELSE
  PRINT NTH "is not a divisor of " n
Check = n % 2
IF Check == 0
  THAN PRINT "Even"
ELSE
  PRINT "Odd"

```
